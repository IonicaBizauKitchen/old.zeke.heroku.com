Today my awesome new teammate [@mattonrails](https://twitter.com/mattonrails) helped me trick out my vim setup.
I'm excited at the prospect of using MacVim regularly as a replacement to TextMate, but I couldn't bear the 
thought of seeing MacVim's nasty Windows-95-lookin' icon in my dock every day. Fortunately I'm not the only person
who feels this way: The talented [Drew Yeaton](http://drewyeaton.com/) created a very nice 
[replacement icon](http://dribbble.com/shots/337065-MacVim-Icon-Updated) which should help make my 
migration from TextMate more bearable.

To install this icon, download [MacVim.icns](http://cl.ly/0f18090S3d2W/download/MacVim.icns) and 
replace the one in `MacVim.app/Contents/Resources`.

I've heard it said before that you have to try vim **five times** before you stick to it -- here's to
round two!
