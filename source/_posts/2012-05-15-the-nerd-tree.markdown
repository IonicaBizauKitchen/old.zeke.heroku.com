While looking over [Chris Continanza](https://twitter.com/#!/em_csquared/)'s shoulder today I couldn't help but notice the awesome tool he was using to navigate directory trees within vim. It's called [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree). Yep, [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree). Being a nerd and an arbophile, I installed it right away and am now climbing trees in vim like a pro. Keyboard-based file navigation in the terminal might just mean one less commercial software dependency in my toolbox: [Forklift](http://binarynights.com/).
