Ruby Installation Woes
----------------------

http://jfire.io/blog/2012/03/02/xcode-4-dot-3-homebrew-and-ruby/

Ruby on Mac OS Lion is going through a bit of a rough patch, installation-wise. With Xcode 4.2, clang became the default compiler and gcc was no longer included. Unfortunately, this has caused a lot of grief for Rubyists on OS X, because for a while, MRI did not officially support compiling with clang. With the release of 1.9.3-p125, that situation has changed–clang is now officially supported–but there are still some gotchas. This post details my toolchain and process for running MRI 1.9.3 and 1.8.7 on Lion with Xcode 4.3.
